      These slow cooker brisket tacos are stuffed with flavorful, tender beef in
      a rich tomato sauce. Dress up your tacos any way you like, e.g. with
      shredded Monterey Jack cheese, pickled red onions, diced tomatoes, sour
      cream, chopped fresh cilantro, and lime wedges.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>24 (6-inch) corn tortillas or taco sized flour tortillas</li>
      <li>3 pounds beef brisket, flat cut; fat trimmed</li>
      <li>1 poblano pepper, seeds removed and sliced, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 (10-ounce) can red enchilada sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together 2 cups beef broth, enchilada sauce, and tomato paste in a
        6-quart slow cooker. Stir in garlic, thyme, bay leaf, chili powder,
        onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place half of the onions and peppers in the slow cooker and set brisket
        on top, fat side up. Sprinkle remaining onions and peppers over the top.
        If meat isnâ€™t submerged in the cooking liquid, add enough beef broth to
        just cover the meat. Cover and cook until meat is fully cooked and
        shreds easily, 8 to 10 hours on Low or 4 to 5 hours on High.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer brisket to a large rimmed baking sheet. Using a slotted spoon,
        remove onions and peppers from the cooking liquid and set aside in a
        bowl. Skim fat from the cooking liquid and reserve cooking liquid to
        moisten the meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut brisket into 2 to 3-inch chunks, then use 2 forks to shred meat.
        Combine shredded meat, cooked onions and peppers, lime juice, and enough
        cooking liquid to moisten meat in a serving bowl. Serve meat in
        tortillas with desired toppings.
      </li>
    </ol>

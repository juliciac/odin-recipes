    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>
        2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
      </li>
      <li>2 green bell peppers, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1/4 cup honey, plus more for serving</li>
      <li>1/3 cup crumbled feta, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Lightly coat the grate
        with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix together garlic, 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, and pepper in a small
        bowl. Toss chicken cubes in the mixture until coated. In a separate bowl
        toss green peppers and onions with remaining olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>Thread chicken, green bell peppers, and onions onto the skewers.</li>
      <li>
        Grill until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run
        clear, turning skewers every few minutes, 15 to 20 minutes. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read 165
        degrees F (74 degrees C). Baste with hot honey during the last 5 minutes
        until lightly charred. Top with extra hot honey and feta. Serve warm.
